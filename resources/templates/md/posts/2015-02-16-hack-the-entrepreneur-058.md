To lead a good life as an entrepreneur your business needs **core values**, lines that you won't cross, projects that you won't take, clients you're not gonna work with.

This **core values** theme reminds me of the _"am I acting like a ..."_ guideline form the "6 months to 6 figures" book.

It also connects with the [latest Developing Perspective episode](http://developingperspective.com/2015/02/11/211/) where David Smith talks about the honesty in the marketing messages for the apps on the App Store.

Another take away is that you shouldn't be harsh with your ideas. It's fine to have a ton of new ideas every day, and they should all be looked at in the same way. The key is then in being honest and focusing only on those that actually sound good.
