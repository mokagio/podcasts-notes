This blog is a simple collection of notes from the podcasts I listen to and find interesting. The reasons is up here are two:

* The content of some podcasts is incredebly valuable, and I don't want to forget it
* I've started playing around with Clojure, and the idea of a blog written in Clojure sounded fun

## About me instead

My name is Gio(vanni), but on the internet I'm [mokagio](https://twitter.com/mokagio).

I'm a iOS engineer consultant, I focus on unit and acceptance testing, and on bringing back from the dead legacy codebases.

I'm also very passionate about learning, and this is why recently I've been so into podcasts.
